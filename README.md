**Quick and essential machine learning hacks for training smart data models**

## What is this book about?
Machine learning makes it possible to learn about the unknowns and gain hidden insights into your datasets by mastering many tools and techniques. This book guides you to do just that in a very compact manner.
After giving a quick overview of what machine learning is all about, Machine Learning Quick Reference jumps right into its core algorithms and demonstrates how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. From model evaluation to optimizing their performance, this book will introduce you to the best practices in machine learning. Furthermore, you will also look at the more advanced aspects such as training neural networks and work with different kinds of data, such as text, time-series, and sequential data. Advanced methods and techniques such as causal inference, deep Gaussian processes, and more are also covered.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get a quick rundown of model selection, statistical modeling, and cross-validation
* Choose the best machine learning algorithm to solve your problem
* Explore kernel learning, neural networks, and time-series analysis
* Train deep learning models and optimize them for maximum performance
* Briefly cover Bayesian techniques and sentiment analysis in your NLP solution
* Implement probabilistic graphical models and causal inferences
* Measure and optimize the performance of your machine learning models

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
#using "resample" function generate a bootstrap sample
boot_samp = resample(dataset, replace=True, n_samples=5, random_state=1)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a machine learning practitioner, data scientist, machine learning developer, or engineer, this book will serve as a reference point in building machine learning solutions. You will also find this book useful if you’re an intermediate machine learning developer or data scientist looking for a quick, handy reference to all the concepts of machine learning. You’ll need some exposure to machine learning to get the best out of this book..
